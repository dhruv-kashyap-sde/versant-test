### Phase 3: Data Collection and Training

#### 7. Collect Data
- **Data Sources**:
  - Gather a diverse dataset of language responses.
  - Ensure data represents different accents, dialects, and proficiency levels.
- **Data Annotation**:
  - Label data for training purposes.
  - Use human reviewers to ensure data quality.

#### 8. Train Models
- **Training Process**:
  - Train your ASR, NLP, and Machine Learning models.
  - Validate models using a separate test dataset.
- **Fine-Tuning**:
  - Continuously fine-tune models based on feedback and additional data.
  - Regularly audit models for bias and accuracy.

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

#### 9. Internal Testing
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Test individual components for functionality.
  - Identify and fix bugs in the early stages.
- **Integration Testing**:
  - Test the integration of various components.
  - Ensure seamless interaction between frontend and backend.

#### 10. Beta Testing
- **Beta Test Group**:
  - Invite a group of test-takers for beta testing.
  - Gather feedback on user experience and performance.
- **Feedback Implementation**:
  - Implement necessary improvements based on feedback.
  - Continuously monitor and update the platform.
